# liangdev.tech


The purpose of this repo is to store any and all progress that I have made on my 
second domain website, liangdev.tech. 

The purpose of the website is for me to have a place to store and showcase 
front-end development projects, as these simply cannot be directly viewed on 
GitHub. It will not serve in place of GitHub, but will serve in conjunction with 
GitHub as windows into my workspace.
